{"prompt": "how do i search for workflowid with partial string ", "response": "In Temporal, the `WorkflowId` is indexed with a `Keyword` type, which optimizes for exact match performance but does not support partial search. However, you can use the `BETWEEN` operator for a \"starts with\" type of search. \n\nFor example, if you want to search for workflows that start with `foo-bar-`, you can use the following query:\n\n```\nWorkflowId BETWEEN \"foo-bar-\" AND \"foo-bar-~\"\n```\n\nThis will match `WorkflowId`s that have characters after `foo-bar-` with ASCII values lower than `~` (126, the highest-value printable character). \n\nPlease note that this method does not support partial string matching in the middle or end of the `WorkflowId`. \n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Temporal Visibility feature documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/visibility#partial-string-match) and the [Temporal Community Forum](https://community.temporal.io/t/9540)."}

{"prompt": "can i replace the while for a series of different ifs? example: if self.state == \"ready\": execute activity A; if self.state == \"something_else\": execute activity B, and so on. I think it may be easier to read (keeping the format of a classic DAG).", "response": "Yes, you can replace the while loop with a series of if statements to check the state and execute the corresponding activity. This can make the workflow logic more explicit and easier to read, especially if you have many different states and activities. Here's a simplified example:\n\n```python\n@workflow.run\nasync def run(self):\n    # This is the main workflow method\n    if self.state == \"ready\":\n        # Execute activity A when the state is \"ready\"\n        activity_a = workflow.new_activity_stub(ActivityA)\n        await activity_a.do_something()\n    elif self.state == \"something_else\":\n        # Execute activity B when the state is \"something_else\"\n        activity_b = workflow.new_activity_stub(ActivityB)\n        await activity_b.do_something()\n    # Add more if/elif statements as needed for other states and activities\n```\n\nIn this example, if statements are used to check the state and execute the corresponding activity. The workflow does not continuously execute the if statements. Instead, the state is checked each time a signal is received and the workflow state is updated [source](https://community.temporal.io/t/7387).\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case and requirements.

{"prompt": "I need a Workflow written in TypeScript", "response": "Sure, here is an example of a simple Workflow written in TypeScript. This Workflow uses the `proxyActivities` function to schedule a `greet` Activity in the system.\n\n```typescript\nimport { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';  \nimport type * as activities from './activities'; // Only import the activity types  \n  \nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({  \n startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',  \n});  \n  \n/** A workflow that simply calls an activity */  \nexport async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {  \n return await greet(name);  \n}  \n```\n\nIn this example, the `example` function is the Workflow. It takes a `name` as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to a string. The Workflow calls the `greet` Activity with the `name` argument.\n\nPlease note that the `greet` Activity is not defined in this code snippet. You would need to define it in your `activities.ts` file.\n\nHere is an example of how you might define the `greet` Activity:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';  \n  \nexport async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {  \n console.log(`Greeting ${name}!`);  \n return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}  \n```\n\nIn this example, the `greet` function is the Activity. It takes a `name` as an argument, logs a greeting message, and returns a greeting string.\n\nRemember, Activities are the only way to interact with the outside world in Temporal (e.g. making API requests, or accessing the filesystem) [source](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/typescript/nextjs#write-your-first-workflow-activity-and-worker).\n\nPlease replace the `greet` function with your own business logic.\n\nYou can find more information about developing Workflows in the [Temporal documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/typescript/foundations#develop-workflows)."}
{"prompt": "is the while loop evaluated on each signal or it is continuously executed?", "response": "In Temporal, the while loop is not continuously executed. Instead, the workflow effectively \"sleeps\" between signals or other events, and does not consume any CPU resources during this time. This is due to Temporal's event sourcing model, where the state of the workflow is reconstructed from the event history when a signal or other event is received.\n\nWhen a signal is received, the workflow wakes up, the state is updated, and the while loop condition is evaluated again. If the condition is met, the loop continues with the next iteration, otherwise, it waits for the next signal or event.\n\nHere's a simplified example:\n\n```python\n@workflow.run\nasync def run(self):\n    # This is the main workflow method\n    while self.state != \"done\":\n        if self.state == \"ready\":\n            # Execute the next activity when the state is \"ready\"\n            activity = workflow.new_activity_stub(MyActivity)\n            await activity.do_something()\n            self.state = \"done\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the while loop condition `self.state != \"done\"` is evaluated each time a signal is received and the workflow state is updated.

{"prompt": "can you provide a similar example of a Workflow Update signal with Python?", "response": "Sure, here's a simplified example of how you might implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio import workflow\n\nclass MyWorkflow:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.state = \"initial\"\n\n    @workflow.run\n    async def run(self):\n        # This is the main workflow method\n        while self.state != \"done\":\n            if self.state == \"ready\":\n                # Execute the next activity when the state is \"ready\"\n                activity = workflow.new_activity_stub(MyActivity)\n                await activity.do_something()\n                self.state = \"done\"\n\n    @workflow.update\n    async def update_state(self, new_state: str) -> str:\n        # This is the update method that updates the state\n        if self.state == \"done\" and new_state == \"ready\":\n            return \"Error: Invalid transition. Cannot set status to 'ready' when current status is 'done'.\"\n        self.state = new_state\n        return \"State updated successfully.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `run` method is the main workflow method. It waits until the state is \"ready\" before executing the next activity. The `update_state` method is the update method that updates the state. When an update is received, it validates the transition. If the transition is invalid (for example, updating to state \"ready\" when the current state is \"done\"), it returns an error [source](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/python/features#updates).\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case and requirements.

{"prompt": "I want to know if all my tasks are done. How do i do that", "response": "You can check the status of your tasks by using Temporal's Web UI. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Visit the Temporal Web UI. The URL is usually `http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:8233` depending on your setup.\n\n2. You will see your Workflow listed there. Click on the **Workflow ID** for your Workflow.\n\n3. Now you can see everything you want to know about the execution of the Workflow, including the input values it received, timeout configurations, scheduled retries, number of attempts, stack traceable errors, and more.\n\n4. You can see the inputs and results of the Workflow Execution by clicking the **Input and Results** section. If the results are still in progress, it means your tasks are not done yet.\n\n5. If there are no Workers connected to the Task Queue, your Workflow hasn't executed yet. You need at least one Worker running to execute your Workflows.\n\nRemember, after a Workflow completes, the full history persists for a set retention period (typically 7 to 30 days) before the history is deleted. You can set up the Archival feature to send these entries to long-term storage for compliance or audit needs.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the Temporal documentation for [Go](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/first_program_in_go#view-the-state-of-the-workflow-with-the-temporal-web-ui), [Python](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/python/first_program_in_python#view-the-state-of-the-workflow-with-the-temporal-web-ui), [Typescript](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/typescript/first_program_in_typescript#view-the-state-of-the-workflow-with-the-temporal-web-ui), and [Java](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/java/first_program_in_java#view-the-state-of-the-workflow-with-the-temporal-web-ui)."}

For instance, you can use Lambda to thumbnail images, transcode videos, index files, process logs, validate content, and aggregate and filter data in real-time.\n\n2. **Real-time Stream Processing**: You can use AWS Lambda to process real-time streams of data for application activity tracking, transaction order processing, clickstream analysis, data cleansing, metrics generation, log filtering, indexing, social media analysis, and IoT device data telemetry and metering.\n\n3. **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Jobs**: AWS Lambda functions can be triggered in response to operations in Amazon's DynamoDB service, and can be used to create a robust pipeline that reacts to changes in DynamoDB tables. This can be used to clean and load streaming data into another database for analysis.\n\n4. **Serverless Backends**: AWS Lambda can be used to create services that scale automatically to meet incoming request traffic. Your application can make HTTP(S) requests to trigger Lambda functions, and then Lambda executes your code and returns the results. This is useful for mobile, web, IoT applications, or third-party API requests.\n\n5. **Scheduled Tasks or Cron Jobs**: AWS Lambda can be used to run code on a scheduled basis. This is useful for running jobs that perform daily tasks, such as report generation, data backup, or sending emails.\n\nPlease note that while AWS Lambda can be used in these scenarios, the specific implementation details and code will depend on the requirements of the use case."}
